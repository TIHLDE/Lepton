## üöÄ Getting started

Lepton requires Docker and Docker Compose.


```
# Setup a local repository
git clone https://github.com/tihlde/Lepton.git
cd Lepton

# If this is your first time running the application
make fresh

# Thats it!
```

From now on it's enough to run `make start` to run the application.

We use [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) to simplify common commands.
Have a look at the `makefile` to find out more about how to run the project without it.


#### ‚öô Configuration
No configuration is required to get started, but if you would like to
configure further or override existing ones, put the following environment variables
in a _.env_ file in the repository root.

```
# Database connection variables
DATABASE_HOST= HOST_URL
DATABASE_NAME= DATABASE_NAME
DATABASE_PASSWORD= PASSWORD
DATABASE_PORT= PORT (normally 3306)
DATABASE_USER= USERNAME

# Optional for using mailing
EMAIL_HOST= HOST_URL
EMAIL_PORT= PORT (normally 587)
EMAIL_USER= EMAIL_USER
EMAIL_PASSWORD= EMAIL_PASSWORD

# Optional for uploading files to Azure
AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING= CONNECTION_STRING
```

## ‚úÖ Test the application
The tests can be run with pytest by running `make test`.

To run with test coverage, run `make test args="--cov"`.
