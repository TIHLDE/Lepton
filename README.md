## üöÄ Getting started

Lepton requires Python 3.6 or higher, Docker and Docker Compose. Other services are handled by Docker.
 

```
# Setup a local repository
git clone https://github.com/tihlde/Lepton.git
cd Lepton

# If this is your first time running the application
make fresh

# Thats it! 
```

From now on it's enough to run `make start` to run the application.

We use [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) to simplify common commands.
Have a look at the `makefile` to find out more about how to run the project without it.


#### ‚öô Configuration
The application requires configuration of some environment variables in order to run. 
These should be put in a _.env_ file in the repository root.

```
DJANGO_SECRET = PUT_A_RANDOM_LONG_STRING_HERE

# Database connection variables
DATABASE_HOST= HOST_URL
DATABASE_NAME= DATABASE_NAME
DATABASE_PASSWORD= PASSWORD
DATABASE_PORT= PORT (normally 3306)
DATABASE_USER= USERNAME

# Optional for using mailing
EMAIL_HOST= HOST_URL
EMAIL_PORT= PORT (normally 587)
EMAIL_USER= EMAIL_USER
EMAIL_PASSWORD= EMAIL_PASSWORD
```

## ‚úÖ Test the application
The tests can be run with pytest by running `make test`.

To run with test coverage, run `make test args="--cov"`.
